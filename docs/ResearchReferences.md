Idea: 

Tabu search is a simple, yet powerful meta-heuristic based on local
search that has been often used to solve combinatorial optimization problems like
the graph coloring problem. What efforts can we make to parallelize this?

The actual algorithm itself looks like it could be implemented fairly briefly so we should just take the direction of trying out some cooperative approaches for parallelization.

See page 35. It gives some directions we could go in.
